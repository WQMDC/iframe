## This is iframe communication - About PostMessage and MessageChannel

PostMessage vs MessageChannel

MessageChannel need PostMessage send message to parent page or brother page

When MessageChannel ports connect, iframe will communication via ports, don't rely on parent page.This is just communication between brother page

When parent page communicate with child page, I think MessageChannel is not different than PostMessage

This is my viewpoint,if you have different viewpoint,please issues

Thanks
